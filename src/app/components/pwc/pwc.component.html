		<p>The patient Welfare Department supports from funds collected through Zakat and other donations. The Senior Medical Officers in rotation examine patients at this clinic and conduct all necessary investigations. In case there is a need, the patient is referred to the Consultant Urologist or Nephrologist for further investigations. Services provided at this clinic include investigations, in-patient admission, lithotripsy and surgical procedures.

            The welfare of patients, both affording and non-affording, is of paramount importance to TKC and it is committed towards helping as many poor patients as possible. The welfare funds, so painstakingly collected, are disbursed by the Patient Welfare Department after careful scrutiny, compassionate consideration and appropriate discretion to help treat poor patients through various services and procedures. It is truly gratifying to note the ever growing number of patients who have been successfully treated as well as the enormous funds collected to meet this demand.</p>
